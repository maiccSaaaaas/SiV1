Image finder, it's quite simple and quick. No instructions because there's a special file called Special_file.sh. Just run it and everything will download automatically. I spent a day and a half working on this project, almost without sleep. I'd be very grateful if you'd give it a star rating. I love you all, good luck to everyone.
